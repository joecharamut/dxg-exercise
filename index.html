<h1>Digital Experience Group Developer Tech Challenge</h1>
<br>

<h2>The Request</h2>
<blockquote>
  I would like to create an app that I can take with me in the state forest, and when I
  encounter certain flora, fauna or points of interest (unique trees, rocks, animals, etc), I
  can snap a photo of it, log in to this app, upload the photo, and store a description about
  it. I would like anyone on my team of 3-5 researchers to have the ability. My team should
  each have their own unique logins to manage the POIs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  I would like the POIs that I upload to be displayed on a website for the public to see,
  overlayed onto a map of the state forest, so others can go observe these unique
  findings. Users on the website should not need to log in to view the map.
</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cross Platform</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In order to make this a cross-platform application, I would recommend we make the website mobile compatible. 
        This would enable both iOS and Android phone platforms to have an easy user experience, 
        without having to develop two different native apps in addition to the main website on PC.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Mapping Platform</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Considering the DXG has used Mapbox in the past, I think it is a good idea to go with a familiar platform.
        Mapbox offers an outdoor map with trails, paths, and terrain visuals <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/maps/outdoors">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Mapbox has methods to add POIs (<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/marker/">which they call markers</a>) 
        to a map which display an icon at some coordinate.
        In this case, I think the photos uploaded would be good to use for those icons.</li>
    <li>Additionally, Mapbox has a product called <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/web-apps/">Mapbox GL JS</a>
        to embed an interactive map into a website, with layers for POIs. This seems perfect for our use case</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Backend</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Because the client wants multiple user accounts to be able to login and manage their own POIs, we would
        need at the very least a database for storing login information. This could also be used to check if a 
        user is allowed to create/edit/delete POIs.</li>
    <li>The login table could be as simple as a user id, username, and password hash. We can use the user id later to
        attach POIs to specific user accounts. We could also have extra fields for maybe a display name or profile picture 
        that can be shown when inspecting the POI.</li>
    <li>The POIs the users make will have to be stored somewhere, that can also be in a database. I think that a 
        point of interest can be represented as a database row of the user id which created it, a creation/modification time, 
        the latitude and longitude of the point, the description of the point, and the photo.</li>
    <li>Storing the photo in the database isn't the best idea, as photos can get quite large and as far as I know that
        would hurt the database performance. Perhaps that can instead be a link to the photo stored 
        somewhere else. I'm not familiar with the DXG server situation so I can't say for certain if we would set up 
        a photo upload endpoint or have that be a different cloud service entirely.</li>
  </ul>
