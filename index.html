<h1>Digital Experience Group Developer Tech Challenge</h1>

<h2>The Request</h2>
<p>
    I would like to create an app that I can take with me in the state forest, and when I
    encounter certain flora, fauna or points of interest (unique trees, rocks, animals, etc), I
    can snap a photo of it, log in to this app, upload the photo, and store a description about
    it. I would like anyone on my team of 3-5 researchers to have the ability. My team should
    each have their own unique logins to manage the POIs.
</p>
<p>
    I would like the POIs that I upload to be displayed on a website for the public to see,
    overlayed onto a map of the state forest, so others can go observe these unique
    findings. Users on the website should not need to log in to view the map.
</p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cross Platform</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to make this a cross-platform application, I would recommend we make the website mobile compatible. 
            This would enable both iOS and Android phone platforms to have an easy user experience, 
            without having to develop two different native apps in addition to the main website on PC.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Mapping Platform</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Considering the DXG has used Mapbox in the past, I think it is a good idea to go with a familiar platform.
            Mapbox offers an outdoor map with trails, paths, and terrain visuals <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/maps/outdoors">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Mapbox has methods to add POIs (<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/marker/">which they call markers</a>) 
            to a map which display an icon at some coordinate.
            In this case, I think the photos uploaded would be good to use for those icons.</li>
        <li>Additionally, Mapbox has a product called <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/web-apps/">Mapbox GL JS</a>
            to embed an interactive map into a website, with layers for POIs. This seems perfect for our use case</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
